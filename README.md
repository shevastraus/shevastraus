### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sheva (pronounced "Sheh-va"). I am a web developer, organiser, creative thinker, and mom.

I started an intership at Leverage IT on May 9, 2022. As an intern, I push code to Bitbucket on a daily basis, but this isn't reflected in my GitHub account. So you'll have to visualise my contribution calendar as completely full of green squares!
