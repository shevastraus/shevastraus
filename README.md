### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sheva (pronounced "Sheh-va"). I am a web developer, organiser, creative thinker, and mom.

I have lots of projects in progress that are not quite ready to be shared just yet. Stay tuned!

I worked as an inter at Leverage IT from May to November 2022. As an intern, I push code to Bitbucket on a daily basis, but this isn't reflected in my GitHub account. So you'll have to visualise my contribution calendar as completely full of green squares during this time period!
